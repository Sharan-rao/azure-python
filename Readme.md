Created an encrypted storage account using Microsoft Managed keys:

- Created a resource group.
- Created an encrypted storage group using MMK
- Created a key vault
- Storing the encrypted key in keyvault as a secret

Could not create new user and assign roles as creating new user or roles as it requires Premium P1 or P2 Subscription. I was able to assign roles via UI to the current user at resource group, vault and storage level and could see the what each role did and the difference between job function role and privilaged administrator role.
